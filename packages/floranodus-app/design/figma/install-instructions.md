- Make sure port 3000 is available
- Run `npm run status` to check connection

### **No nodes appearing in Figma?**
- Make sure your Figma file is open in browser
- Check the console for plugin connection messages
- The unified bridge auto-installs and connects the plugin

### **VS Code Figma panel not showing designs?**
- Click "Refresh" in the Figma panel
- Make sure your file URL is correct in `design-links.json`
- Check your internet connection
